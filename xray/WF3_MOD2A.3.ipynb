Except for the APEX1-independent resolution of AP sites via single nucleotide base excision repair mediated by NEIL1 or NEIL2 (Wiederhold et al. 2004, Das et al. 2006), single nucleotide and multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathways are both initiated by APEX1-mediated displacement of DNA glycosylases and cleavage of the damaged DNA strand by APEX1 immediately 5' to the AP site (Wilson et al. 1995, Bennett et al. 1997, Masuda et al. 1998). The BER proceeds via the single nucleotide replacement when the AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) deoxyribose residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created single strand break (SSB) (5'dRP) can be removed by the 5'-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase beta (POLB) (Bennett et al. 1997). POLB fills the created single nucleotide gap by adding a nucleotide complementary to the undamaged DNA strand to the 3' end of the SSB. The SSB is subsequently ligated by DNA ligase III (LIG3) which, in complex with XRCC1, is recruited to the BER site by an XRCC1-mediated interaction with POLB (Kubota et al. 1996). BER proceeds via the multiple-nucleotide patch replacement pathway when the AP residue at the 5' end of the APEX1-created SSB undergoes oxidation-related damage (5'ddRP) and cannot be cleaved by POLB (Klungland and Lindahl 1997). Long-patch BER can be completed by POLB-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis in the presence of PARP1 or PARP2, FEN1 and DNA ligase I (LIG1) (Prasad et al. 2001). When the PCNA-containing replication complex is available, as is the case with cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, DNA strand displacement synthesis is catalyzed by DNA polymerase delta (POLD) or DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) complexes, in the presence of PCNA, RPA, RFC, APEX1, FEN1 and LIG1 (Klungland and Lindahl 1997, Dianova et al. 2001). It is likely that the 9-1-1 repair complex composed of HUS1, RAD1 and RAD9 interacts with and coordinates components of BER, but the exact mechanism and timing have not been elucidated (Wang et al. 2004, Smirnova et al. 2005, Guan et al. 2007, Balakrishnan et al. 2009).     \",\n",

      "                        \"description\": \"GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. GABA modulates neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. Disruption of GABA neurotransmission leads to many neurological diseases including epilepsy and a general anxiety disorder. GABA is synthesized by two distinct enzymes GAD67 and GAD65 that differ in their cellular localization, functional properties and co-factor requirements. GABA synthesized by GAD65 is used for neurotransmission whereas GABA synthesized by GAD67 is used for processes other than neurotransmission such as synaptogenesis and protection against neuronal injury. GABA is loaded into synaptic vesicle with the help of vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter or VGAT. GAD65 and VGAT are functionally linked at the synaptic vesicle membrane and GABA synthesized by GAD65 is preferentially loaded into the synaptic vesicle over GABA synthesized in cytoplasm by GAD67.The GABA loaded synaptic vesicles are docked at the plasma membrane with the help of the SNARE complexes and primed by interplay between various proteins including Munc18, complexin etc. Release of GABA loaded synaptic vesicle is initiated by the arrival of action potential at the presynaptic bouton and opening of N or P/Q voltage gated Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ influx results in Ca2+ binding by synaptobrevin, which is a part of the SNARE complex that also includes SNAP25 and syntaxin, leading to synaptic vesicle fusion. Release of GABA in the synaptic cleft leads to binding of GABA by the GABA receptors and post ligand binding events.\",\n",

      "                        \"description\": \"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) was first described in the model organism E. coli in the early 1960s as a process whereby bulky base damage is enzymatically removed from DNA, facilitating the recovery of DNA synthesis and cell survival. Deficient NER processes have been identified from the cells of cancer-prone patients with different variants of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD), and Cockayne's syndrome. The XP cells exhibit an ultraviolet radiation hypersensitivity that leads to a hypermutability response to UV, offering a direct connection between deficient NER, increased mutation rate, and cancer. While the NER pathway in prokaryotes is unique, the pathway utilized in yeast and higher eukaryotes is highly conserved.<BR>NER is involved in the repair of bulky adducts in DNA, such as UV-induced photo lesions (both 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPDs) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)), as well as chemical adducts formed from exposure to aflatoxin, benzopyrene and other genotoxic agents. Specific proteins have been identified that participate in base damage recognition, cleavage of the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion, and excision of the oligonucleotide bearing the lesion. Reparative DNA synthesis and ligation restore the strand to its original state.<BR>NER consists of two related pathways called global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The pathways differ in the way in which DNA damage is initially recognized, but the majority of the participating molecules are shared between these two branches of NER. GG-NER is transcription-independent, removing lesions from non-coding DNA strands, as well as coding DNA strands that are not being actively transcribed. TC-NER repairs damage in transcribed strands of active genes.<BR>Several of the proteins involved in NER are key components of the basal transcription complex TFIIH. An ubiquitin ligase complex composed of DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 participates in both GG-NER and TC-NER, implying an important role of ubiquitination in NER regulation. The establishment of mutant mouse models for NER genes and other DNA repair-related genes has been useful in demonstrating the associations between NER defects and cancer.<BR>For past and recent reviews of nucleotide excision repair, please refer to Lindahl and Wood 1998, Friedberg et al. 2002, Christmann et al. 2003, Hanawalt and Spivak 2008, Marteijn et al. 2014).\",\n",

The mechanism must elicit rapid changes in heart rate and respond to changes in autonomic tone. The cardiac action potential controls these functions. Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions through transmembrane ion channels in cardiac cells. Like skeletal myocytes (and axons), in the resting state, a given cardiac myocyte has a negative membrane potential. In both muscle types, after a delay (the absolute refractory period), K+ channels reopen and the resulting flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarisation. The voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on the cardiac sarcolemma membrane are generally triggered by an influx of Na+ during phase 0 of the action potential. Cardiac muscle cells are so tightly bound that when one of these cells is excited the action potential spreads to all of them. The standard model used to understand the cardiac action potential is the action potential of the ventricular myocyte (Park & Fishman 2011, Grant 2009).<br><br>The action potential has 5 phases (numbered 0-4). Phase 4 describes the membrane potential when a cell is not being stimulated. The normal resting potential in the ventricular myocardium is between -85 to -95 mV. The K+ gradient across the cell membrane is the key determinant in the normal resting potential. Phase 0 is the rapid depolarisation phase in which electrical stimulation of a cell opens the closed, fast Na+ channels, causing a large influx of Na+ creating a Na+ current (I<sub>Na+</sub>). This causes depolarisation of the cell. The slope of phase 0 represents the maximum rate of potential change and differs in contractile and pacemaker cells. Phase 1 is the inactivation of the fast Na+ channels. The transient net outward current causing the small downward deflection (the \\\"notch\\\" of the action potetial) is due to the movement of K+ and Cl- ions. In pacemaker cells, this phase is due to rapid K+ efflux and closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. Phase 2 is the plateau phase which is sustained by a balance of Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux. This phase sustains muscle contraction. Phase 3 of the action potential is where a concerted action of two outward delayed currents brings about repolarisation back down to the resting potential (Bartos et al. 2015).\",\n",

Activation requires phosphorylation by a cytosolic adenosine phosphotransferase and deamination by ADAL deaminase to yield carbovir monophosphate. Cytosolic nucleotide kinases convert carbovir monophosphate to carbovir triphosphate, the active HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

Although several of the individual reactions in this sequence are reversible, as indicated by the double-headed arrows in the diagram, other irreversible steps drive the pathway in the direction of IMP synthesis in the normal cell.  All of these reactions are thus annotated here only in the direction of IMP synthesis.  Guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) are synthesized from IMP (Zalkin & Dixon 1992).<p>The pyrimidine orotate (orotic acid) is synthesized in a sequence of four reactions, deriving its atoms from glutamine, bicarbonate, and aspartate. A single multifunctional cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the first three of these reactions, while the last one is catalyzed by an enzyme associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. In two further reactions, catalyzed by a bifunctional cytosolic enzyme, orotate reacts with 1-phosphoribosyl 5-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to yield orotidine 5'-monophosphate, which is decarboxylated to yield uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP). While several individual reactions in this pathway are reversible, other irreversible reactions drive the pathway in the direction of UMP biosynthesis in the normal cell. All reactions are thus annotated here only in the forward direction.<p>This pathway has been most extensively analyzed at the genetic and biochemical level in hamster cell lines. All three enzymes have also been purified from human sources, however, and the key features of these reactions have been confirmed from studies of this human material (Jones 1980).<p>All other pyrimidines are synthesized from UMP. The reactions annotated here, catalyzed by dCMP deaminase and dUTP diphosphatase yield dUMP, which in turn is converted to TMP by thymidylate synthase.\",\n",

ATM coordinates the recruitment of DNA repair and signaling proteins to DSBs and formation of the so-called ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). While IRIFs include chromatin regions kilobases away from the actual DSB, this Reactome pathway represents simplified foci and shows events that happen at the very ends of the broken DNA.<p>For both HRR and SSA to occur, the ends of the DNA DSB must be processed (resected) to generate lengthy 3' ssDNA tails, and the resulting ssDNA coated with RPA complexes, triggering ATR activation and signaling.<p>After the resection step, BRCA2 and RAD51 trigger HRR, a very accurate process in which the 3'-ssDNA overhang invades a sister chromatid, base pairs with the complementary strand of the sister chromatid DNA duplex, creating a D-loop, and uses the complementary sister chromatid strand as a template for DNA repair synthesis that bridges the DSB.<p>The SSA is triggered when 3'-ssDNA overhangs created in the resection step contain highly homologous direct repeats. In a process involving RAD52, the direct repeats in each 3'-ssDNA overhang become annealed, the unannealed 3'-flaps excised, and structures then processed by DNA repair synthesis. SSA results in the loss of one of the annealed repeats and the DNA sequence between the two repeats. Therefore, SSA is error-prone and is probably used as a backup for HRR, with RAD52 loss-of-function mutations being synthetically lethal with mutations in HRR genes, such as BRCA2 (reviewed by Ciccia and Elledge 2010).\",\n",

Eicosanoids are  synthesized in humans primarily from arachidonic acid (all-cis 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid) that is released from membrane phospholipids. Once released, arachidonic acid is acted on by prostaglandin G/H synthases (PTGS, also known as cyclooxygenases (COX)) to form prostaglandins and thromboxanes, by arachidonate lipoxygenases (ALOX) to form leukotrienes, epoxygenases (cytochrome P450s and epoxide hydrolase) to form epoxides such as 15-eicosatetraenoic acids, and omega-hydrolases (cytochrome P450s) to form hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008).<br>Levels of free arachidonic acid in the cell are normally very low so the rate of synthesis of eicosanoids is determined primarily by the activity of phospholipase A2, which mediates phospholipid cleavage to generate free arachidonic acid. The enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism are typically constitutively expressed so the subset of these enzymes expressed by a cell determines the range of eicosanoids it can synthesize.<br>Eicosanoids are unstable, undergoing conversion to inactive forms with half-times under physiological conditions of seconds or minutes. Many of these reactions appear to be spontaneous.\",\n",

The enzymes involved are a set of transferases which perform the transfer of the cofactor group to the substrate.

Although most conjugations result in pharmacological inactivation or detoxification, some can result in bioactivation. Most of the phase II enzymes are located in the cytosol except  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT), which are microsomal. Phase II reactions are typically much faster than phase I reactions therefore the rate-limiting step for biotransformation of a compound is usually the phase I reaction.<br>Phase II metabolism can deal with all the products of phase I metabolism, be they reactive (Type I substrate) or unreactive/poorly active (Type II substrate) compounds. With the exception of glutathione, the conjugating species needs to be made chemically reactive after synthesis. The availability of the cofactor in the synthesis may be a rate-limiting factor in some phase II pathways as it may prevent the formation of enough conjugating species to deal with the substrate or it's metabolite. As many substrates and/or their metabolites are chemically reactive, their continued presence may lead to toxicity.\",\n",

      "                        \"description\": \"In response to exposure to elevated temperature and certain other proteotoxic stimuli (e.g., hypoxia, free radicals) cells activate a number of cytoprotective mechanisms known collectively as \\\"heat shock response\\\".  Major aspects of the heat shock response (HSR) are evolutionarily conserved events that allow cells to recover from protein damage induced by stress (Liu XD et al. 1997; Voellmy R & Boellmann F 2007;  Shamovsky I & Nudler E 2008; Anckar J & Sistonen L 2011). The main hallmark of HSR is the dramatic alteration of the gene expression pattern. A diverse group of protein genes is induced by the exposure to temperatures 3-5 degrees higher than physiological. Functionally, most of these genes are molecular chaperones that ensure proper protein folding and quality control to maintain cell proteostasis.<p>At the same time, heat shock-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha leads to the shutdown of the nascent polypeptide synthesis reducing the burden on the chaperone system that has to deal with the increased amount of misfolded and thermally denatured proteins (Duncan RF & Hershey JWB 1989; Sarkar A et al. 2002;  Spriggs KA et al. 2010).<p>The induction of HS gene expression primarily occurs at the level of transcription and is mediated by heat shock transcription factor HSF1(Sarge KD et al. 1993; Baler R et al. 1993). Human cells express five members of HSF protein family: HSF1, HSF2, HSF4, HSFX and HSFY. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat inducible gene expression (Zuo J et al. 1995; Akerfelt M et al. 2010). HSF2 is activated in response to certain developmental stimuli in addition to being co-activated with HSF1 to provide promoter-specific fine-tuning of the HS response by forming heterotrimers with HSF1 (Ostling P et al. 2007; Sandqvist A et al. 2009). HSF4 lacks the transcription activation domain and acts as a repressor of certain genes during HS (Nakai A et al. 1997; Tanabe M et al. 1999; Kim SA et al. 2012). Two additional family members HSFX and HSFY, which are  located on the X and Y chromosomes respectively, remain to be characterized (Bhowmick BK et al. 2006; Shinka T et al. 2004; Kichine E et al. 2012).<p>Under normal conditions HSF1 is present in both cytoplasm and nucleus in the form of an inactive monomer. The monomeric state of HSF1 is maintained by an intricate network of protein-protein interactions that include the association with HSP90 multichaperone complex, HSP70/HSP40 chaperone machinery, as well as intramolecular interaction of two conserved hydrophobic repeat regions. Monomeric HSF1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser303 and Ser 307 by (Zou J et al. 1998; Knauf U et al. 1996; Kline MP & Moromoto RI 1997; Guettouche T et al. 2005). This phosphorylation plays an essential role in ensuring cytoplasmic localization of at least a subpopulation of HSF1 molecules under normal conditions (Wang X et al. 2004).<p>Exposure to heat and other proteotoxic stimuli results in the release of HSF1 from the inhibitory complex with chaperones and its subsequent trimerization, which is promoted by its interaction with translation elongation factor eEF1A1 (Baler R et al. 1993; Shamovsky I et al. 2006; Herbomel G et al 2013). The trimerization is believed to involve intermolecular interaction between hydrophobic repeats 1-3 leading to the formation of a triple coil structure. Additional stabilization of the HSF1 trimer is provided by the formation of intermolecular S-S bonds between Cys residues in the DNA binding domain (Lu M et al.2008). Trimeric HSF1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus where it binds the specific sequence in the promoter of hsp genes (Sarge KD et al. 1993; Wang Y and Morgan WD 1994). The binding sequence for HSF1 (HSE, heat shock element) contains series of inverted repeats nGAAn in head-to-tail orientation, with at least three elements being required for the high affinity binding. Binding of the HSF1 trimer to the promoter is not sufficient to induce transcription of the gene (Cotto J et al. 1996). In order to do so, HSF1 needs to undergo inducible phosphorylation on specific Ser residues such as Ser230, Ser326. This phosphorylated form of HSF1 trimer is capable of increasing the promoter initiation rate. HSF1 bound to DNA promotes recruiting components of the transcription mediator complex and  relieving promoter-proximal pause of RNA polymerase II through its interaction with TFIIH transcription factor (Yuan CX & Gurley WB 2000).<p>HSF1 activation is regulated in a precise and tight manner at multiple levels (Zuo J et al. 1995; Cotto J et al. 1996). This allows fast and robust activation of HS response to minimize proteotoxic effects of the stress. The exact set of HSF1 inducible genes is probably cell type specific. Moreover, cells in different pathophysiological states will display different but overlapping profile of HS inducible genes.\",\n",

      "                        \"description\": \"Homology directed repair (HDR) through microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is an error prone process also known as alternative nonhomologous end joining (alt-NHEJ), although it does not involve proteins that participate in the classical NHEJ. Contrary to the classical NHEJ and other HDR pathways, homologous recombination repair (HRR) and single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ does not require ATM activation. In fact, ATM activation inhibits MMEJ. Therefore, MMEJ may be triggered when the amount of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) overwhelms DNA repair machinery of higher fidelity or when cells are deficient in components of high fidelity DNA repair.<p>MMEJ is initiated by a limited resection of DNA DSB ends by the MRN complex (MRE11A:RAD50:NBN) and RBBP8 (CtIP), in the absence of CDK2-mediated RBBP8 phosphorylation and related BRCA1:BARD1 recruitment (Yun and Hiom 2009). Single strand DNA (ssDNA) at resected DNA DSB ends recruits PARP1 or PARP2 homo- or heterodimers, together with DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) and FEN1 5'-flap endonuclease. In a poorly studied sequence of events, POLQ promotes the annealing of two 3'-ssDNA overhangs through microhomologous regions that are optimally 10-19 nucleotides long. Using analogy with POLB-mediated long patch base excision repair (BER), it is plausible that PARP1 (or PARP2) dimers coordinate the extension of annealed 3'-ssDNA overhangs via POLQ-mediated strand displacement synthesis with FEN1-mediated cleavage of the resulting 5'-flaps (Liang et al. 2005, Mansour et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2015, Kent et al. 2015, Ciccaldi et al. 2015, Mateos-Gomez et al. 2015). The MRN complex subsequently recruits DNA ligase 3 (LIG3) bound to XRCC1 (LIG3:XRCC1) to ligate the remaining single strand nicks (SSBs) at MMEJ sites (Della-Maria et al. 2011).<p>Similar to single strand annealing (SSA), MMEJ leads to deletion of one of the microhomology regions used for annealing and the DNA sequence in between two annealed microhomology regions. MMEJ, just like classical NHEJ, can result in genomic translocations (Ghezraoui et al. 2014). In addition, since POLQ is an error-prone DNA polymerase, MMEJ introduces frequent base substitutions (Ceccaldi et al. 2015).\",\n",

Genes regulated by retinoids are essential for reproduction, embryonic development, growth, and multiple processes in the adult, including energy balance, neurogenesis, and the immune response. The retinoid used as a cofactor in the visual cycle  is 11-cis-retinal (11cRAL). The non-visual cycle effects of retinol are mediated by retinoic acid (RA), generated by two-step conversion from retinol (Napoli 2012).  All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) is the major activated metabolite of retinol. An isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) has biological activity, but has not been detected in vivo, except in the pancreas. An alternative route involves BCO1 cleavage of carotenoids into retinal, which is then reduced into retinol in the intestine (Harrison 2012). The two isomers of RA serve as ligands for  retinoic acid receptors (RAR) that regulate gene expression. (Das et al. 2014). RA is catabolised to oxidised metabolites such as 4-hydroxy-, 18-hydroxy-  or 4-oxo-RA by CYP family enzymes, these metabolites then becoming substrates for Phase II conjugation enzymes (Ross & Zolfaghari 2011).\",\n",

The first two are synthesized from acetyl-CoA, in the mitochondria of liver cells; acetone is formed by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Ketone body synthesis in liver is effectively irreversible because the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA is not present in liver cells.<P>Ketone bodies, unlike fatty acids and triglycerides, are water-soluble. They are exported from the liver, and are taken up by other tissues, notably brain and skeletal and cardiac muscle. There, they are broken down to acetyl-CoA which is oxidized via the TCA cycle to yield energy. In a normal person, this pathway of ketone body synthesis and utilization is most active during extended periods of fasting. Under these conditions, mobilization and breakdown of stored fatty acids generates abundant acetyl-CoA acetyl-CoA in liver cells for synthesis of ketone bodies, and their utilization in other tissues minimizes the demand of these tissues for glucose (Sass 2011).\",\n",

Amide linkage of a fatty acid to sphingosine yields ceramides. Esterification of phosphocholine to ceramides yields sphingomyelin, and ceramide glycosylation yields glycosylceramides. Introduction of sialic acid residues yields gangliosides. These molecules appear to be essential components of cell membranes, and intermediates in the pathways of sphingolipid synthesis and breakdown modulate processes including apoptosis and T cell trafficking.<p>While sphingolipids are abundant in a wide variety of foodstuffs, these dietary molecules are mostly degraded by the intestinal flora and intestinal enzymes. The body primarily depends on de novo synthesis for its sphingolipid supply (Hannun and Obeid 2008; Merrill 2002). De novo synthesis proceeds in four steps: the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine to form 3-ketosphinganine, the reduction of 3-ketosphinganine to sphinganine, the acylation of sphinganine with a long-chain fatty acyl CoA to form dihydroceramide, and the desaturation of dihydroceramide to form ceramide.<p>Other sphingolipids involved in signaling are derived from ceramide and its biosynthetic intermediates. These include sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) 1-phosphate, phytoceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate.<p>Sphingomyelin is synthesized in a single step in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus from ceramides generated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and transferred to the Golgi by CERT (ceramide transfer protein), an isoform of COL4A3BP that is associated with the ER membrane as a complex with PPM1L (protein phosphatase 1-like) and VAPA or VAPB (VAMP-associated proteins A or B). Sphingomyelin synthesis appears to be regulated primarily at the level of this transport process through the reversible phosphorylation of CERT (Saito et al. 2008).<br>\",\n",

The biosynthesis of RvEs occurs mainly during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes. EPA, circulating in plasma or released/mobilised from damaged cellular membranes on injury or infection, moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation where it is converted to exudate RvEs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). The initial transformation of EPA by aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase 2- and/or cytochrome P450-mediated catalysis can produce stereospecific resolvins (18(R)- or 18(S)-RvEs). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions determine the type of resolvin formed (RvE1, RvE2 or RvE3) (Serhan et al. 2000, 2002, Serhan & Petasis 2011, Maehre et al. 2015). \",\n",

Mono-, di-, and triphosphorylation of the inositol ring generates a wide variety of stereochemically distinct signalling entities.  Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3), is formed when the phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is hydrolysed by a phospholipase C isozyme.  An array of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and tetrakisphosphate (IP4) molecules are synthesised by the action of various kinases and phosphatases in the cytosol.  These species then transport between the cytosol and the nucleus where they are acted on by inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK), inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) and 2 (IP6K2), to produce IP5, IP6, IP7, and IP8 molecules.  Some of these nuclear produced IPs transport back to the cytosol where they are converted to an even wider variety of IPs, by kinases and phosphatases, including the di- and triphospho inositol phosphates aka pyrophosphates (Irvine & Schell 2001, Bunney & Katan 2010, Alcazar-Romain & Wente 2008, York 2006, Monserrate and York 2010).\",\n",

Bacteria in infected individuals, however, are typically confined to the lining of the throat or to a skin lesion; systemic effects are due to the secretion of an exotoxin encoded by a lysogenic bacteriophage. The toxin is encoded as a single polypeptide but is cleaved by host furin-like proteases to yield an aminoterminal fragment A and a carboxyterminal fragment B, linked by a disulfide bond. Toxin cleavage can occur when it first contacts the target cell surface, as annotated here, or as late as the point at which fragment A is released into the cytosol. Fragment B mediates toxin uptake into target cell endocytic vesicles, where acidification promotes a conformational change enabling fragment B to form a channel in the vesicle membrane through which fragment A is extruded into the target cell cytosol. Cleavage of the inter-fragment disulfide bond frees DT fragment A, which catalyzes ADP ribosylation of the translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) in a target cell, thereby blocking protein synthesis. Neither fragment is toxic to human cells by itself (Collier 1975; Pappenheim 1977; Murphy 2011).\",\n",

The biosynthesis of RvDs occurs mainly during the process of inflammation when endothelial cells interact with leukocytes. Dietary DHA circulates in plasma or is present in cellular membranes as it can easily integrate into membranes. On injury or infection, DHA moves with edema into the tissue sites of acute inflammation where it is converted to exudate RvDs to interact with local immune cells (Kasuga et al. 2008). The initial transformation of DHA by aspirin-acetylated cyclooxygenase-2 or cyclooxygenase-mediated catalysis can produce stereospecific D-resolvins (18(R)- or 18(S)-RvDs respectively). Combinations of oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis reactions determine the type of D-resolvin formed (RvD1-6) (Serhan et al. 2002, Serhan & Petasis 2011, Serhan et al. 2014). \",\n",

Making them more chemically reactive would facilitate their excretion but also increases their chance of reacting with cellular macromolecules (e.g. proteins, DNA). There is a fine balance between producing a more reactive metabolite and conjugation reactions.<br>There are two groups of enzymes in phase 1 - oxidoreductases and hydrolases. Oxidoreductases introduce an oxygen atom into or remove electrons from their substrates. The major oxidoreductase enzyme system is called the P450 monooxygenases.

There are four steps to this process: oxidation, hydration, a second oxidation, and finally thiolysis. The last step releases the two-carbon acetyl-CoA and a ready primed acyl-CoA that takes another turn down the spiral. In total each turn of the beta-oxidation spiral produces one NADH, one FADH2, and one acetyl-CoA.<p>Further oxidation of acetyl-CoA via the tricarboxylic acid cycle generates additional FADH2 and NADH. All reduced cofactors are used by the mitochondrial electron transport chain to form ATP. The complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule produces numerous ATP molecules. Palmitate, used as the model here, produces 129 ATPs.<p>Beta-oxidation pathways differ for saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The beta-oxidation of saturated fatty acids requires four different enzymatic steps. Beta-oxidation produces and consumes intermediates with a trans configuration; unsaturated fatty acids that have bonds in the cis configuration require three separate enzymatic steps to prepare these molecules for the beta-oxidation pathway.\",\n",

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids. Humans cannot synthesize them, instead they are supplied through diet. Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2(n-6)), a major component of omega-6 fatty acids and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:2(n-3)) a major component of omega-3 fatty acids are the two main dietary essential fatty acids (EFAs) in humans. ALA and LA obtained from diet are converted in the body into their longer chain and more unsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 products by a series of desaturation and elongation steps. Metabolism of ALA and LA to their corresponding products is mediated via common enzyme systems. In humans ALA is finally converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6(n-3)), and LA is converted to docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5(n-6)). The intermediary omega-3 and omega-6 series fatty acids play a significant role in health and disease by generating potent modulatory molecules for inflammatory responses, including eicosanoids (prostaglandins, and leukotrienes), and cytokines (interleukins) and affecting the gene expression of various bioactive molecules (Kapoor & Huang 2006, Sprecher 2002, Burdge 2006).\",\n",

It is hypothesized that calcium influx and energy depletion are the signals that initiate changes in gene expression leading to new mitochondrial proteins. Energy depletion causes a reduction in ATP and an increase in AMP which activates AMPK. AMPK in turn phosphorylates the coactivator PGC-1alpha (PPARGC1A), one of the master regulators of mitochondrial biosynthesis. Likewise, p38 MAPK is activated by muscle contraction (possibly via calcium and CaMKII) and phosphorylates PGC-1alpha. CaMKIV responds to intracellular calcium by phosphorylating CREB, which activates expression of PGC-1alpha.<br>Deacetylation of PGC-1alpha by SIRT1 may also play a role in activation (Canto et al. 2009, Gurd et al. 2011), however Sirt11 deacetylation of Ppargc1a in mouse impacted genes related to glucose metabolism rather than mitochondrial biogenesis (Rodgers et al. 2005) and mice lacking SIRT1 in muscle had normal levels of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to exercise (Philp et al. 2011) so the role of deacetylation is not fully defined. PGC-1beta and PPRC appear to act similarly to PGC-1alpha but they have not been as well studied.<br>Phosphorylated PGC-1alpha does not bind DNA directly but instead interacts with other transcription factors, notably NRF1 and NRF2 (via HCF1). NRF1 and NRF2 together with PGC-1alpha activate the transcription of nuclear-encoded, mitochondrially targeted proteins such as TFB2M, TFB1M, and TFAM.\",\n",

They are major constituents of muscle protein. The breakdown of these amino acids starts with two common steps catalyzed by enzymes that act on all three amino acids: reversible transamination by branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, and irreversible oxidative decarboxylation by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Isovaleryl-CoA is produced from leucine by these two reactions, alpha-methylbutyryl-CoA from isoleucine, and isobutyryl-CoA from valine. These acyl-CoA's undergo dehydrogenation, catalyzed by three different but related enzymes, and the breakdown pathways then diverge. Leucine is ultimately converted to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate; isoleucine to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA; and valine to succinyl-CoA. Under fasting conditions, substantial amounts of all three amino acids are generated by protein breakdown. In muscle, the final products of leucine, isoleucine, and valine catabolism can be fully oxidized via the citric acid cycle; in liver they can be directed toward the synthesis of ketone bodies (acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA) and glucose (succinyl-CoA) (Chuang & Shih 2001, Sweetman & Williams 2001).\",\n",

Newly synthesized bile salts are secreted into the bile and released into the small intestine where they emulsify dietary fats (Russell 2003). About 95% of the bile salts in the intestine are recovered and returned to the liver (Kullak-Ublick et al. 2004; Trauner and Boyer 2002). The major pathway for bile salt synthesis in the liver begins with the conversion of cholesterol to 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol. Bile salt synthesis can also begin with the synthesis of an oxysterol - 24-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol. In the body, the initial steps of these two pathways occur in extrahepatic tissues, generating intermediates that are transported to the liver and converted to bile salts via the 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol pathway. These extrahepatic pathways contribute little to the total synthesis of bile salts, but are thought to play important roles in extrahepatic cholesterol homeostasis (Javitt 2002).\",\n",

      "                        \"description\": \"Visual phototransduction is the process by which photon absorption by visual pigment molecules in photoreceptor cells is converted to an electrical cellular response. The events in this process are photochemical, biochemical and electrophysiological and are highly conserved across many species. This process occurs in two types of photoreceptors in the retina, rods and cones. Each type consists of two parts, the outer segment which detects a photon signal and the inner segment which contains the necessary machinery for cell metabolism. Each type of cell functions differently. Rods are very light sensitive but their flash response is slow so they work best in twilight conditions but are not good at detecting objects moving quickly. Cones are less light-sensitive and have a fast flash response so they work best in daylight conditions and are better at detecting fast moving objects than rods.<br><br>The visual pigment consists of a chromophore (11-cis-retinal, 11cRAL, A1) covalently attached to a GPCR opsin family member. The linkage is via a Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. Upon photon absorption, 11cRAL isomerises to all-trans retinal (atRAL), changing the conformation of opsin to an activated form which can activate the regulatory G protein transducin (Gt). The alpha subunit of Gt activates phosphodiesterase which hydrolyses cGMP to 5'-GMP. As high level of cGMP keep cGMP-gated sodium channels open, the lowering of cGMP levels closes these channels which causes hyperpolarization of the cell and subsequently, closure of voltage-gated calcium channels. As calcium levels drop, the level of the neurotransmitter glutamate also drops causing depolarization of the cell. This effectively relays the light signal to postsynaptic neurons as electrical signal (Burns & Pugh 2010, Korenbrot 2012, Pugh & Lamb 1993).<br><br>11cRAL cannot be synthesised in vertebrates. Vitamin A from many dietary sources is the precursor for 11cRAL. It is taken from food in the form of esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate or one of four caretenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin). Retinoids are transported from the gut to be stored in liver, until required by target organs such as the eye (Harrison & Hussain 2001, Harrison 2005). In the eye, in the form 11cRAL, it is used in the retinoid (visual) cycle to initiate phototransduction and for visual pigment regeneration to ready the photoreceptor for the next phototransduction event (von Lintig 2012, Blomhoff & Blomhoff 2006, von Lintig et al. 2010, D'Ambrosio et al. 2011, Wang & Kefalov 2011, Kefalov 2012, Wolf 2004).\",\n",

The third hydroxyl of LXA4 is positioned at C-6, and of LXB4 at C-14.  The action of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), in concert with an arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) or arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15) activity, has been shown to produce lipoxins by three distinct pathways.  Neutrophil ALOX5 can produce and secrete leukotriene A4 (LTA4) that is taken up by platelets, where it is acted upon by ALOX12 to form lipoxins. Likewise, ALOX15s can generate either 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE) or 15-hydro-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) that can be taken up by monocytes and neutrophils, where highly expressed ALOX5 uses it to generate lipoxins. Finally, aspirin acetylated prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PTGS2), rendered unable to synthesize prostaglandins, can act as a 15-lipoxygenase. This leads to the formation of 15R-HETE and culminates in creation of epi-lipoxins, which have altered stereochemistry at the C-15 hydroxyl but similar biological potency (Chiang et al. 2006, Buczynski et al. 2009, Vance & Vance 2008, Stsiapanava et al. 2017).\",\n",

      "                        \"description\": \"PTEN is regulated at the level of gene transcription, mRNA translation, localization and protein stability.<p>Transcription of the PTEN gene is regulated at multiple levels. Epigenetic repression involves the recruitment of Mi-2/NuRD upon SALL4 binding to the PTEN promoter (Yang et al. 2008, Lu et al. 2009) or EVI1-mediated recruitment of the polycomb repressor complex (PRC) to the PTEN promoter (Song et al. 2009, Yoshimi et al. 2011). Transcriptional regulation is also elicited by negative regulators, including NR2E1:ATN1 (atrophin-1) complex, JUN (c-Jun), SNAIL and SLUG (Zhang et al. 2006, Vasudevan et al. 2007, Escriva et al. 2008, Uygur et al. 2015) and positive regulators such as TP53 (p53), MAF1, ATF2, EGR1 or PPARG (Stambolic et al. 2001, Virolle et al. 2001, Patel et al. 2001, Shen et al. 2006, Li et al. 2016).<p>MicroRNAs miR-26A1, miR-26A2, miR-22, miR-25, miR-302, miR-214, miR-17-5p, miR-19 and miR-205 bind PTEN mRNA and inhibit its translation into protein. These microRNAs are altered in cancer and can account for changes in PTEN levels (Meng et al. 2007, Xiao et al. 2008, Yang et al. 2008, Huse et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2010, Poliseno, Salmena, Riccardi et al. 2010, Cai et al. 2013). In addition, coding and non-coding RNAs can prevent microRNAs from binding to PTEN mRNA. These RNAs are termed competing endogenous RNAs or ceRNAs. Transcripts of the pseudogene PTENP1 and mRNAs transcribed from SERINC1, VAPA and CNOT6L genes exhibit this activity (Poliseno, Salmena, Zhang et al. 2010, Tay et al. 2011, Tay et al. 2014).<p>PTEN can translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after undergoing monoubiquitination. PTEN's ability to localize to the nucleus contributes to its tumor suppressive role (Trotman et al. 2007). The ubiquitin protease USP7 (HAUSP) targets monoubiquitinated PTEN in the nucleus, resulting in PTEN deubiquitination and nuclear exclusion. PML, via an unknown mechanism that involves USP7- and PML-interacting protein DAXX, inhibits USP7-mediated deubiquitination of PTEN, thus promoting PTEN nuclear localization. Disruption of PML function in acute promyelocytic leukemia, through a chromosomal translocation that results in expression of a fusion protein PML-RARA, leads to aberrant PTEN localization (Song et al. 2008).<p>Several ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4, WWP2, STUB1 (CHIP), RNF146, XIAP and MKRN1, polyubiquitinate PTEN and target it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Wang et al. 2007, Van Themsche et al. 2009, Ahmed et al. 2011, Maddika et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2015, Li et al. 2015). The ubiquitin proteases USP13 and OTUD3, frequently down-regulated in breast cancer, remove polyubiquitin chains from PTEN, thus preventing its degradation and increasing its half-life (Zhang et al. 2013, Yuan et al. 2015). The catalytic activity of PTEN is negatively regulated by PREX2 binding (Fine et al. 2009, Hodakoski et al. 2014) and TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination (Lee et al. 2013), most likely through altered PTEN conformation.<p>In addition to ubiquitination, PTEN also undergoes SUMOylation (Gonzalez-Santamaria et al. 2012, Da Silva Ferrada et al. 2013, Lang et al. 2015, Leslie et al. 2016). SUMOylation of the C2 domain of PTEN may regulate PTEN association with the plasma membrane (Shenoy et al. 2012) as well as nuclear localization of PTEN (Bassi et al. 2013, Collaud et al. 2016). PIASx-alpha, a splicing isorom of E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS2 has been implicated in PTEN SUMOylation (Wang et al. 2014). SUMOylation of PTEN may be regulated by activated AKT (Lin et al. 2016). Reactions describing PTEN SUMOylation will be annotated when mechanistic details become available.<p>Phosphorylation affects the stability and activity of PTEN. FRK tyrosine kinase (RAK) phosphorylates PTEN on tyrosine residue Y336, which increases PTEN half-life by inhibiting NEDD4-mediated polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PTEN. FRK-mediated phosphorylation also increases PTEN enzymatic activity (Yim et al. 2009). Casein kinase II (CK2) constitutively phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of PTEN on serine and threonine residues S370, S380, T382, T383 and S385. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases PTEN protein stability (Torres and Pulido 2001) but results in ~30% reduction in PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (Miller et al. 2002).<p>PTEN localization and activity are affected by acetylation of its lysine residues (Okumura et al. 2006, Ikenoue et al. 2008, Meng et al. 2016). PTEN can undergo oxidation, which affects its function, but the mechanism is poorly understood (Tan et al. 2015, Shen et al. 2015, Verrastro et al. 2016).\",\n",

Deacetylation and methylation of histone H3 in the chromatin of a rRNA gene by eNoSC causes reduced expression of the gene.  When glucose is low, NAD is high (NADH is low), activity of SIRT1 is high, and activity of rRNA genes is reduced. It is hypothesized that eNoSC forms on a nucleosome containing dimethylated lysine-9 on histone H3 (H3K9me2) and then eNoSC deacetylates and dimethylates the adjacent nucleosome, thus catalyzing spreading of H3K9me2 throughout the gene.\",\n",

In the first step, L-threonine is oxidised to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate. This reaction is catalysed by mitochondrial L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase tetramer (TDH tetramer). In the second step, mitochondrial 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (GCAT, aka KBL) catalyses the reaction between 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate and coenzyme A to form glycine and acetyl-CoA. GCAT resides on the mitochondrial inner membrane in dimeric form and requires pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PXLP) as cofactor. GCAT is thought to exist on the mitochondrial inner membrane in complex with TDH. With these two enzymes located together, it stops the rapid and spontaneous decarboxylation of 2A-3OBU to aminoacetone and carbon dioxide and instead, results in glycine formation (Tressel et al. 1986).\",\n",

Excessive dietary intake of fructose and its metabolism have been associated with major disease risks in humans, although this issue remains controversial (Kolderup & Svihus 2015; DiNicolantonio et al. 2015; Bray 2013; Mayes 1993; Rippe & Angelopoulos 2013; van Buul et al. 2013). Fructose can also be synthesized from glucose via the polyol pathway (Hers 1960; Oates 2008). This synthetic process provides the fructose found in seminal fluid and, in other tissues, can contribute to pathologies of diabetes.\",\n",

In addition, glycerophospholipids act as precursors of lipid mediators such as platelet-activating factor and eicosanoids.  Cellular membranes contains a distinct composition of various glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), cardiolipin (CL), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and lysobisphosphatidic acid (also known as bis(monoacylglycerol) hydrogen phosphate - BMP).<br><br>Glycerophospholipids are first formed by the <i>de novo</i> (Kennedy) pathway using fatty acids activated as acyl-CoA donors.  However, the acyl groups of glycerophospholipids are highly diverse and distributed in an asymmetric manner.  Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are usually esterified at the <i>sn-1</i> position, whereas polyunsaturated acyl groups are esterified at the <i>sn-2</i> position.  Subsequent acyl chain remodeling (Lands cycle) generates the diverse glycerophospholipid composition and asymmetry characteristic of cell membranes.<br><br>In the <i>de novo</i> pathway of glycerophospholipid biosynthesis, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is initially formed from glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P).  Next, LPA is converted to PA by a LPA acyltransferase (AGPAT, also known as LPAAT), then PA is metabolized into two types of glycerol derivatives.  The first is diacylglycerol (DAG) which is converted to triacylglycerol (TAG), PC, and PE.  Subsequently, PS is synthesized from PC or PE.  The second is cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), which is processed into PI, PG, CL, and BMP.  Each glycerophospholipid is involved in acyl chain remodeling via cleavage by phospholipases followed by reacylation by an acyltransferase.<br><br>Most of the glycerophospholipids are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), however, some, most notably cardiolipin, and BMP are synthesized in the mitochondrial and endosomal membranes respectively.  Since the most of the glycerophospholipids are found in all membrane compartments, there must be extensive network of transport of glycerophospholipids from one membrane compartment to another via various mechanisms including diffusion through the cytosol, formation of transportation complexes, and diffusion via membrane contact sites (MCS) (Osman et al. 2011, Lebiedzinska et al. 2009, Lev 2010, Scherer & Schmitz 2011, Orso et al. 2011, Hermansson et al. 2011, Vance & Vance 2008).\",\n",

They regulate energy metabolism and stress responses (glucocorticoids), salt balance (mineralocorticoids), and sexual development and function (androgens and estrogens). All steroids are synthesized from cholesterol. Steroid hormone synthesis is largely regulated at the initial steps of cholesterol mobilization and transport into the mitochondrial matrix for conversion to pregnenolone. In the body, the fate of pregnenolone is tissue-specific: in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex it is converted to cortisol, in the zona glomerulosa to aldosterone, and in the gonads to testosterone and then to estrone and estradiol. These pathways are outlined in the figure below, which also details the sites on the cholesterol molecule that undergo modification in the course of these reactions.\",\n",

Its breakdown is a major source of energy for all cells, and is essential for the brain and red blood cells. Glucose utilization begins with its uptake by cells and conversion to glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot traverse the cell membrane. Fates open to cytosolic glucose 6-phosphate include glycolysis to yield pyruvate, glycogen synthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. In some tissues, notably the liver and kidney, glucose 6-phosphate can be synthesized from pyruvate by the pathway of gluconeogenesis.\",\n",
